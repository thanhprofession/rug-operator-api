# Rug Operator API

## Description
I went with a very simple solution by using a bare Express application and using Node's pg library to connect to Postgres.

To start the application, clone this repository and cd into the root folder of the project. Then run npm install and npm start!

To make it work with Postgres you'll have to add the Postgres credentials componentController file.
